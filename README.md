# phac_lethbridge
Variety of scripts I used during my time in Lethbridge working for PHAC

The commands.txt file contains most of the commands I ran using command line, be it for other programs or scripts I wrote.
It leaves off where I started doing more work with R: all those commands are saved in R scripts.
